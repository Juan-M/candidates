# Candidates
Test repo to play around with nest.js and angular and showcase coding skills.

### Running the app

``` bash
# from root folder
npm run inst-all
npm start
```

Then go to http://localhost:4200/ for the frontend app

And http://localhost:3000/api for the backend's swagger

### Disclaimer

This exercise has been constructed in a limited time frame, specifically according to a certain code challenge and its requirements, without paying too much attention to matters I'd normally care about in real projects. For example, I have not done an extensive due diligence for the versions and dependencies I'm using here. Some of them are too brand new and may present warnings that are not yet possible to be fixed. In real world I'd fallback to known LTS versions, but for this learning exercise, all is fine 🔥🐕🔥.
Please excuse and disregard all that install ugliness.

### Pending

- Basic form validation.
- Extend features, like adding a delete to remove candidates or a load/save feature.
- Better error handling for the backend.
- Proper test setup and coverage
